This is pretty much a rip-off off the Wikir example for the Limonade framework.
https://github.com/organicweb/limonade-wiki-example/
I modified it to just merge plain HTML files.

What it can do:
- It has a router, so it (potentially) can do RESTful stuff.
- It has limited templating capabilities (as much as php has)
- It is still all about plain HTML files (if you want to)

What it cannot do:
- anything else, including authentication.

IT IS MOST PROBABLY DANGEROUS TO USE !!!
