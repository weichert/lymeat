This is pretty much a rip-off off the Wikir example for the Limonade framework.

https://github.com/organicweb/limonade-wiki-example/

I modified it to just merge plain HTML files.

What it can do:
- It has a router, so it can do RESTful stuff.
- It has limited templating capabilities
- It is still all about plain HTML files

What it cannot do:
- anything else, including authentication.

You may like it if the only thing you really want your CMS to do is to conditionally compile HTML like I wanted.

Yes, it's not a beauty!
